#Rotated pong

A variant of pong made using the Pygame engine. Allows the user to rotate their paddle and move it on the x axis 


Notable implemented features include:

Collision detection using masks: More advanced collision detection making use of masks for pixel perfect collision. This is essential for allowing collision with a rotated paddle 

More math: In comparison to the simple math required for my pong game,the mathematics required to make this game work well are much more complex
Normal lines and vector reflection are used to determine the new velocity of the ball upon impact
