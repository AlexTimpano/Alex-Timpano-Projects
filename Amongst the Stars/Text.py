INTRO_LORE="The year is 2075.The world has drastically changed and has become unrecognizeable from the world just decades ago. A new world order has risen. Four major entites have come to dominate the politics of Earth, the cradle of humanity. Atomantia, The Utopia Corporation, The Republican Federation, and the New Foundations Group all compete for influence in this new world. Not content to dominate the Earth, these groups have now set their sights on the final frontier. Decades of fast-paced technological advancement have finally allowed the colonization of new worlds. Your job is now to help one of these factions prove that humanity has a place amongst the stars by managing a self-sufficient colony for 50 days without external aid. Do you have what it takes to ensure that humanity has a place amongst the stars?"

UTC_NAME="Utopia Corp."
UTC_LORE="A self-proclaimed 'gigacorporation', the Utopia Corporation is by far the largest Corporation on Earth. After having secured their rule on Earth they decided to reach out to the stars. They're masters of finance and can turn an otherwise unprofitable venture into a massive success. They're also good at making electricity. Having kids is too expensive"

RF_NAME="Republican Federation"
RF_LORE="The Republican Federation(RF) is a multi-continental nation unified by the ideals of equality and democracy. The RF is determined to achieve humanity's manifest destiny. 'Domination over the stars at any cost'. They have advanced water acquisition tech and a high population growth but the ineffiencies of their government reduce their income somewhat."
RF_BONUSES="Bonuses: Water: +15% Money: -10% Population: +5%"

NF_NAME="New Foundations"
NF_LORE="Founded by a combination of scientists and philanthropic industrialists the New Foundations group seeks to colonize other worlds not for any specific entity or political ideology but for all of mankind. They have devised sophisticated population growth programs and have access to top-tier building material production tech. The other three factions have refused to share their power generation secrets with the group."
NF_BONUSES="Bonuses: Building materials: +5% Population: +15% Power: -10%"


MERCURY_NAME="Mercury"
MERCURY_LORE="Mercury is the first planet from the sun and is the second hottest planet in the solar system. Colonization of this planet will be impeded by longer transit times will impede economic growht but the close proximity to the sun and lack of atmosphere will allow more effective power generation"
MERCURY_BONUSES="Population: -10% Power: +10%"


VENUS_NAME="Venus"
VENUS_LORE="Despite being the second farthest planet from the sun Venus is actually the hottest planet thanks to its extremely thick CO2 atmosphere. Extreme heat, high pressure, and sulphuric acid make Venus one of the most challenging candiates for colonization. Venus is almost entirely devoid of liquid water and the surface conditions make importing expensive and risky but the CO2 in the atmosphere can be split to produce large quantities of oxygen."
VENUS_BONUSES="Oxygen: +10% Water: -10%"

MARS_NAME="Mars"
MARS_LORE="The original colonization candidate. The colonization of mars has been a dream of humanity since the 20th century and now the opportunity has arisen to make it a reality. Due to a combination of distance from the sun and thin atmosphere both solar and wind power are less effective. Though still barren Mars is a much more hospitable planet than other options and travel times are decent which will improve immigration. "

MOON_NAME="Moon"
MOON_LORE="In the mid-20th century Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon. Since then humans have visited the moon a few more times but have not established a permanent presence on the Moon. Its closeness to Earth will allow the easy flow of goods and services, strengthing the local economy. A lack of water combined with unusually low gravity makes both hydroponics and aeroponics less effective."
MOON_BONUSES="Food: -10% Money: +10%"


TITAN_NAME="Titan"
TITAN_LORE="Titan is a moon of the planet Saturn and exists beyond the asteroid belt. It is unique in that is has a thick nitrogen-methane atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane on its surface. The abundance of methane will contribute to fuelling a growing industrial base on the planet but the lack of oxygen-containing compounds will inhibit oxygen production."
TITAN_BONUSES="Oxygen: -10% Building Materials: +10%"

EUROPA_NAME="Europa"
EUROPA_LORE="Europa is a moon of the planet Jupiter and is made almost entirely of water. The planet has a thick shell of ice and a large subsurface ocean that may be home to extraterrestrial life. Liquid water is easily acquired on Europa but building materials will have to be imported."
