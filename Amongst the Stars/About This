#ABout this project

Amongst the Stars is a simple game where you have to represent a faction of your choice in a colonization effort of your chosen planet. Your goal is to survive 50 days 
without support from Earth to prove that your colony can be self-sufficient for large periods of time. 

Notable implemented features include:

Faction and planet system: Your chosen faction and planet will provide modifiers to your resource production. These can be crucial to your survival strategy 

UI: A simple UI that displays information on available resources, allows users to build and deconstruct buildings, and see their current statistics

Build and deconstruct buildings: You can construct and destroy a variety of buildings to produce resources. implemented a power consumption and maintenance system. Buildings now take time to build

Simple 2D graphics: A step up from my purely text based version of this game. This game has actual graphics!
